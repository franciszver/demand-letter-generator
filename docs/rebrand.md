# Retheming Prompt for AI Agent

**Objective:**  
Retheme and rebrand the existing *Demand Letter Generator* application at the **UI/UX level only**. Do not change or remove any functionality, APIs, workflows, project names, GitHub repo names, or resource identifiers. The goal is to present the product as a polished, professional, standalone module called **Steno Draft**, designed for law firms and attorneys who want to save time.

---

## 1. Product Naming

- **UI/UX Name:** Steno Draft  
- **Tagline:** “Generate demand letters in minutes, not hours.”  
- **Context:** This is a standalone module that looks like part of Steno’s litigation technology suite but is branded independently as *Steno Draft*.  

---

## 2. Visual Theme

- **Colors:** Strictly follow Steno’s brand palette (navy blue, charcoal gray, teal, white, with gold/silver accents).  
- **Typography:**  
  - Headings: Serif or bold professional fonts (authority).  
  - Body: Clean sans-serif fonts (clarity, modern SaaS).  
- **UI Style:**  
  - Minimalist, professional dashboards.  
  - Legal-themed icons (scales, shield, book).  
  - Emphasis on trust, clarity, and ease of use.  

---

## 3. Tone of Copy

- **Law firm tone**: authoritative, professional, concise.  
- Replace technical jargon with **lawyer-friendly language**.  
- Focus on **efficiency and time savings** in all messaging.  

---

## 4. Messaging Pillars

Reframe all UI copy and presentation around:

- **Efficiency:** “Save hours on every case by automating demand letter drafting.”  
- **Consistency:** “Firm-wide templates ensure every letter meets your standards.”  
- **Collaboration:** “Attorneys and paralegals edit together in real time.”  
- **Compliance:** “Secure, encrypted, and audit-ready for litigation workflows.”
